# üö® Database Connection Error Fix Guide

## The Problem
Your browser console is showing the error:
```
Database connection string not found. Please set NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL or DATABASE_URL environment variable
```

This happens because your Next.js application is trying to connect to a Neon PostgreSQL database, but the required environment variables are not configured.

## ‚úÖ Solution Steps

### Step 1: Get Your Neon Database Connection String

1. **Go to Neon Console**: Visit [console.neon.tech](https://console.neon.tech)
2. **Find your project**: Look for `snowy-firefly-88207333`
3. **Get connection string**: In your dashboard, find the connection string that looks like:
   ```
   postgresql://username:password@ep-something-123456.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require
   ```

### Step 2: Update Environment Variables

I've already created a `.env.local` file for you. **Replace the placeholder values** with your real credentials:

```env
# Replace this with your ACTUAL Neon connection string
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://your-username:your-password@your-host.neon.tech/your-dbname?sslmode=require

# Generate secure random strings for these
JWT_SECRET=generate-a-long-random-string-here
MIGRATION_SECRET=generate-another-random-string-here
```

### Step 3: Set Up Database Tables

After updating the environment variables, run:

```bash
npm run db:setup
```

This will create the required `users` table in your database.

### Step 4: Start Your Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## üîç How to Generate Secure Secrets

For `JWT_SECRET` and `MIGRATION_SECRET`, use random strings. You can generate them with:

```bash
# In your terminal
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

Run this twice to get two different secrets.

## üåê For Production (Netlify)

When deploying to Netlify, set these environment variables in your Netlify dashboard:

- `NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL` (your Neon connection string)
- `JWT_SECRET` (same as local)
- `MIGRATION_SECRET` (same as local)

## ‚ú® What This Fixes

- ‚úÖ Database connection errors in browser console
- ‚úÖ Authentication system functionality
- ‚úÖ User registration and login
- ‚úÖ Secure JWT token handling

## üÜò If You Still Have Issues

1. Double-check your Neon connection string format
2. Ensure your Neon database is active and accessible
3. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
4. Check that the `users` table was created successfully

After following these steps, your application should connect to the database successfully and the console errors will disappear!
