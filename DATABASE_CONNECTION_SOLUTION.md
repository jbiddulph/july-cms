# Database Connection Issue - Solution

## Problem
The application was showing: "Database connection string not found. Please set NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL or DATABASE_URL environment variable"

## Root Cause
1. **Local Development**: Missing `.env.local` file with database credentials
2. **Password Issue**: The connection string provided had a masked password (`npg_sfoyqxxxxxxxx`)

## Solutions Implemented

### âœ… 1. Created `.env.local` file for local development
- Added `.env.local` file in the project root
- This file is automatically loaded by Next.js during development
- The setup script (`scripts/setup-db.js`) also loads this file using dotenv

### âœ… 2. Installed missing dependencies
- Added `dotenv` package for the setup script to work properly
- All npm dependencies are now installed

## Next Steps Required

### ðŸ”§ For Local Development
1. **Update `.env.local`** with your complete database connection string:
   - Go to your Netlify dashboard
   - Navigate to your site settings â†’ Environment variables
   - Copy the COMPLETE `NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL` value (not the masked version)
   - Replace `YOUR_ACTUAL_PASSWORD_HERE` in `.env.local` with the actual password

2. **Test the connection**:
   ```bash
   npm run db:setup
   ```

### ðŸš€ For Netlify Deployment
Your Netlify environment variable is correctly set. However, if you're still seeing the error in Netlify:

1. **Check when the error occurs**:
   - During build time: Environment variables should be available
   - During runtime: Verify the variable is accessible in your deployment context

2. **Possible Netlify fixes**:
   - Ensure the environment variable is not marked as "Build-time only" if you need it at runtime
   - Redeploy your site to ensure the latest environment variables are picked up
   - Check Netlify Functions logs if the error occurs in serverless functions

## Testing
Once you update `.env.local` with the correct password:
```bash
# Test database setup
npm run db:setup

# Run the application
npm run dev
```

## File Structure Created/Modified
- âœ… `.env.local` - Local environment variables
- âœ… `package.json` - Added dotenv dependency
- âœ… All dependencies installed

## Environment Variable Priority
The application checks for database connection in this order:
1. `NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL`
2. `DATABASE_URL`

Both variables work, so you can use either one.
